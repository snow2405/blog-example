Debugging is always painful, but debugging at **midnight** feels especially special

- **The pain** with the time going by, and the moon rising, the pain to debug increases proportionally to the progress of the night. 
- **The relive** if the debug attempt was succesfully however, is also proportional to the time spent on said bug and the "lateness" of the night.

Importantly, debugging at midnight does not prove to be more effective. It is however, in aggregate, less painful due to the added relive that comes with solving problems so late at night.
